# A slightly different kind of challenge this morning.

# The Company has broken the keyboard on their one and only laptop, so canâ€™t get this bit of code to run. What would the output of this code be (without running it on your own computer)? 

 def fib(num)
  if num < 2
     num
  else
     fib(num-1) + fib(num-2)
  end
end

# It would output a syntax error due to the underscore instead of a close parenthesis on line 5.
puts  fib(55)
