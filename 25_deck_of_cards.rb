# Create a Deck class that uses the Card class you created last time.
#
# Deck functionality
# A deck has a public attribute:
#
# cards: array of remaining cards in the deck.
#
# ...and three public methods:
#
# count(): count of remaining cards in the deck.
#
# shuffle(): randomize the order of the remaining cards in the deck.
#
# draw(n): remove the last n cards from the deck and return them in an array.
#
# Upon initialization, a deck is filled with 52 cards (13 from each of 4 suits).
